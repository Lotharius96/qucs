qucs main executable

this is meant to provide new and other ways to run qucs, without interference.

- main executables could use different (possibly platform dependent)
  configuration management, such as QucsSettings, or gconf, or just environment
  variables.

- main executables could use different ways to load different sets of plugins
  at startup, including ways this could be implemented.

- when using qucs as a shared library, none of this will be necessary

see gnucap/main and gnucap-custom how this is meant to work in detail.
(here, some decruft will be required)
